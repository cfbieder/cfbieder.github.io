                <h1>Objective</h1>
                    <p>This visualization was created for the CS498 Data Visualizaiton Course with the objective of creating a visualization based upon 2017 OECD statistics.  The dataset was source from:</p>
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jej13b/oecd-better-life-index">Dateset source : Kaggle</a>
                <h1>Structure</h1>
                    <p>The structure of the project follow that of an ineractive slide show.</p>
                    <p>The flow of the slides is driven by the author with navigation arrows indicating the order to proceed with.</p>
                    <p>Thereafter each page allows for the user to interact with the data to see different representation of it.</p>
                <h1>Scene Utilizations</h1>
                    <p>Each slide of the scene utilizes a consitant format and colloring scheme.  Additionally the navigation highligted
                        with arrows are similiar on each page to ensure the user can easily get confortale with navigation through the deck.</p>
                    <P>On each slide the ability to hover over items to obtain more insight is consitant as is the format and content of the 
                        data selection drop down bar on the 2nd and 3rd slide.</P>
                    <p>The first slides presents an overview of each country in the survey and thier respective quality of life rating.</p>
                    <p>The second slide highlights factors that were considered in the survey allowing the the user to explore each of these factors.</p>
                    <p>The third slide presents a graphical correlation of these factors to satisfaction, again allowing user interaction to select
                            which factor to explore.</p>
                        <p>Each visualiztion is scaled appropriately utilizing the D3 scale functions</p>
                <h1>Use of Annotations</h1>
                    <p>Each slide contains two types of annotations, (1) the ability to hover over a bar or circle to see the info on the data point
                        and (2) "Info" points highlighed on appropriate slides that when hovered over present more information to the user on observations 
                        from the data.</p>
                    <p>The hover over data (e.g. graph or point) annotations are cleared and refreshed each time a new page is loaded or 
                        the parameter, as discussed below, is changed.  The source of the this annotation is the actual data point stored in a 
                        JSON array</p>
                    <p>The "Info" annotations are cleared upon each slide or change in parameter with a new info point arising if appropriate. The 
                        visualization allows for a JSON array containing the data points for the "Info" annotations.  This JSON array contains data on
                        which slide, which parameter and location to display the "Info" symbol.  The JSON array also contains info on what data is to be
                        displayed upon a hover.</p>
                    <P>Both forms of annotations utilize a similiar template and method for visualization, namely a mouse hover. </P>
                <h1>Use of Parameters</h1>
                    <p>The parameters that can be change is on the 2nd and 3rd slide which allows the user to dynamically change teh selected factor and
                        update the data points appropriately.</p>
                    <p>The visualization utilizes the D3 filtering function achieve this.</p>
                    <p>The user is clearly informed in a consitant manner on slide 2 and 3 on the use of the dropdown box to change the parameter.</p>
                    <p></p>
                <h1>Use of Triggers</h1>
                    <p>There are two triggers utilized in the visualization (1) page navigation utilizing arrows to direct the user of the sequence of
                        the slides and (2) triggers to change the factors to explore on the 2nd and 3rd slide.</p>
                    <p>The navigation trigger utlizes a button with a HTML reference to the next page to load upon click</p>
                    <p>The trigger to change the factor utilizes D3 to attach a filter function to the dropdown box, whereby when changed
                        a D3 transition is triggered to present the updated data.</p>
                    <p>Both triggers are explicitly highlighted to the user with the use of color and shape of the button for navigation and clear
                        instructions on the use of the trigger for the factor selection.
                    </p>
